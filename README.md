Flappy Man is a popular mobile game that has 
been adapted to various platforms, including 
desktop and web browsers. In this project, we 
developed a Flappy Man game using Python 
programming language, which is an interpreted, 
high-level, general-purpose programming 
language. The game was developed using the 
Pygame library, which is a cross-platform set of 
Python modules designed for video game 
development.

The goal of the game is to control a Man and 
navigate it through a series of obstacles by 
flapping its wings. The player must time the Man's 
flapping to avoid obstacles and progress as far as 
possible. The game is over if the man collides with 
an obstacle or falls to the ground. and that where the game ends ðŸ˜‰.
